*Some Garbage I Used to Believe About Equality*

* What steps does Nightingale suggest someone take to educate themselves about inequality? Have you encountered this idea before? Does Nightingale’s suggestion feel radical to you? Why? Why does he suggest going to the lengths he does?
------------------------------------------

Honestly, Nightingale doesn't seem to point to many useful resources outside of twitter, and a list of books and articles. He isn't explicit about it but he asks other white men to recognize the history of oppression that marginalized groups have endured. Most of today's institutions, particularly Governmental, were "modernized" through slow integration during and after Jim Crow, their policies crafted when culture was more blatantly racist and having that perspective was normalized. Public discourse about racial and gender equality is often times carried out and debated by white men. I have more than encountered this idea before, and he doesn't suggest we go far enough. Only once does he ask that they listen, and ask questions, to those who have backgrounds different than us. He doesn't reference empathy.  He mainly talks to the other white men, about himself, or about women/POC who have been oppressed in some way.

* Nightingale describes the temptation to “want to be able to have an intellectual conversation about [social issues and people’s experiences].” What damage can intellectual conversation at the wrong time have? When is the right time for intellectual conversation?
------------------------------------------
I think that the election of Donald Trump makes the question of safe spaces an important one. The election result throws a lot of the status quo into question. Without fully understanding where a person is coming from, it is important to at least set the expectation of respect and empathy when engaging in these discussions, and knowing when to end them. It can damage your perspective of the person, when you may not fully be understanding where they're coming from. If I'm finding myself disagreeing with someone on a social justice issue, I will point them towards resources that will help then try to understand my point of view, and will ask for them to provide me with some as well.

* Nightingale identifies as a white male and targets his message particularly at others of that group. If you’re a white male, what parts of Nightingale’s perspective do you find especially challenging? If you’re not a white male, what would your version of Nightgale’s post look like for the communities you identify with? What would your message of social responsibility look like?
----------------------------------------
I really have trouble with this question. You are asking for white males to offer their perspective, while you are asking the rest of us to come up with a plan to educate the public. This is a role I often have to take on, it is all of our own responsibilities to educate ourselves and help others stay woke.
